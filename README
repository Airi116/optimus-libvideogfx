Optimus - LibVideoGfx - efficient video processing library

INTRODUCTION

Optimus-LibVideoGfx is a C++ library for low-level video processing, designed to speed up the development process for image and video processing applications through high-level classes for standard tasks. The library offers support for:

- basic image data classes
- color-space conversion for RGB, YUV, HSV
- drawing primitives (lines, circles, ...)
- image manipulation (scaling, pixel-ops, convolution)
- file-IO (ppm, yuv, jpeg, png, mpeg, V4L-grabbing)
- X11 image display (including Xv-extension support)

Moreover, it supports:

- bit-stream reading/writing
- popular container classes (dynamic array, heap, queue, ...)
- processor feature detection

Optimus-LibVideoGfx includes MMX accelerated routines, used if an MMX capable processor is detected. However, the library provides scalar replacement routines and can thus be compiled on all UNIX platforms (including CygWin).

JPEG file access requires the libjpeg. If this library cannot be detected during library configuration, JPEG support is disabled. The MPEG reader relies on the DVDview MPEG decoding program.
