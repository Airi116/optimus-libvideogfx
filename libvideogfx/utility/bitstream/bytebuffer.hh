  purpose:
   Each ByteBuffer encapsulates a dynamically allocated memory area
   to which an arbitrary amount of bytes may be appended. It
   automatically enlarges if more data is appended than the current
   buffer can hold.

  notes:
  1) You must not acquire several pointers using GetPtrToAppendToBuffer() to
     fill the associated memory area later. Strictly speaking you have to get
     the pointer and fill the memory area before you call any non-const method
     with this ByteBuffer-object again.

  to do:

  author(s):
   - Dirk Farin, dirk.farin@gmx.de

  modifications:
   28/Sep/1999 - Dirk Farin
     - Memory is now allocated via a MemoryAllocator object for better performance.
     - ByteBuffer statistics are now held externally in a ByteBufferParams
       structure that can be shared across multiple ByteBuffer objects.
   18/Dec/1998 - Dirk Farin
     - Changed several int-types to unsigned to eliminate compiler warnings.
   20/Nov/1998 - Dirk Farin
     - introduced TruncateBuffer()
   15/Nov/1998 - Dirk Farin
     - first implementation
